		<p> Project initiation is  where you develop key documents and processes. We are going call this the <strong>discovery</strong> phase to link it to
			our common  <%= link_to ' IT management structure', page_path('opsmgt')  %>. This activity is a continuation of the orgainisations strategic planning process,
			where oragnisatudoion goals are defined. We should achknowledge here that the organisation has already done a lot of work prior to starting this project
			and we are just moving to the next phase in the continuing change driven by organisations. We should already be able to see strategic business plans, prioritisation of the plans
			and goals and a good description of what the organisation wants to achieve with this project.
			In this phase, you produce a Project Management Plan which cotains information like a high level scope, project charter and how the project will run. 
			What the company wants to acheive and how this is measured essentially what sucess looks like, aligned to the stratgic plan. 
			You produce a high esitmate of cost, resourses and duration as well as a strawman plan, team structure, a communication plan
			(including all stakeholders), a high level risk assessment and quality plan. You may also need to consider 3rd party vendors in your plan.

		<p> The following will take you through a step by step approach to setting up a project in the application OpenProject. 
			We are going to make up a project called <strong>"Product X"</strong> which is a new product that the company will launch. This will require the IT department to
			<ul> 
				<li>Reconfigure the Enterprise Resource Management system</li>
				<li>Install new hardware</li>
				<li>Provide new desktop systems</li>
				<li>Reconfigure the web site</li> 
				</ul>
				In the real world, it will be more complicated but this is for demonstration purposes only</p>
		<p> If you are new to OpenProject, there is a more  <%= link_to 'basic guide', page_path('openprojectsetup')  %> to 
			getting started with OpenProject which you may want to review first</p>
			<p> <strong>The discovery steps we will go through are</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Confirm that Openproject has all the correct roles and definitions needed for this project</li>
					<li>Add the startup project team to OpenProject</li>
					<li>Create the project as a sub project of the main IT Program</li>
					<li>Create 3 sub projects to split the work into the logical streams</li>
					<li>Assign the team to the projects</li>
					<li>Build the task list in the story board</li>
					<li>Complete the assigned tasks in the discovery phase, ready for approval to move to the second phase</li>
				</ul></p>
				<p>You, as the project manager will use OpenProject as will the architect and business SME(s) who will create documents to be saved
					in OpenProject and some of the team may start logging time/effort to your project so they will need access.</p>
				<h4>Confirm Setup</h4>
		<p>In the Admin module under Roles, confirm all the roles that this project will need are availalble in OpenProject. The roles should cover the spectrum of IT services
	and project management as well as key business roles. If you followed the <%= link_to 'basic guide', page_path('openprojectsetup')  %>  you will have reviewed
	the following.
	</p>
	<p>A suggested set of roles to choose from</p>
			<ul>
				<li>IT Roles</li>
				<ul>
					<li>IT Manager</li>
					<li>Project Manager</li>
					<li>PMO</li>
					<li>System Administrator</li>
					<li>DBA</li>
					<li>Network</li>
					<li>Help Desk</li>
					<li>Application Administrator</li>
					<li>Tester</li>
					<li>Developer</li>
					<li>Consultant</li>

</p>
<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/roles1.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), class: 'centre' %>
		<p>In the Enumerations section, confirm that you have al the time tracking activities that you need defined.
			 If you followed the <%= link_to 'basic guide', page_path('openprojectsetup')  %>  you will have reviewed
	the following.</p>
			<p>A suggested set of time categories to measure</p>

		<h4>Team Setup</h4>
		<p>Add the team</p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/users1.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), class: 'centre' %>

		<p>You will need to add the current project team to OpenProject. You will need just the basic team, the project manager, any PMO or assistance you use, the 
			architect or designer, the business SME(s) and team members who will participate in this discovery phase. The aim is to keep it simple.</p>

<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/users2.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), class: 'centre' %>

		<p>Turn off all email notifications, again to keep it simple. You can ramp this up once the IT team have more experience with OpenProject. The same with LDAP
			authentication.</p>
			<p>Set the time zone as this will make the calendar work correctly and time stamp events correctly</p>
			<p>You can set up rates if you want to dive into the cost account module, but again, I would not recommend it for new starter.</p>
<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/user3.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), class: 'centre' %>
		
		<h4>Create the Project</h4>
		<p>We will now create our project and the 3 sub projects</p> 
		
		<p>The project design  </p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/Project design.png",:size => '250x100', alt: "Project Mgt"  ),'#', class: 'pull-left' %>
		<p>
			The <strong>IT Mgt Tier</strong> represents the department programs and will hold multiple projects as well as opertional programs. <p>The
			<strong>Project X</strong>  tier will hold the main project structures such as project execution, monitoring and reporting. </p>
			<p>The <strong>Sub Projects</strong> will mainly hold the task lists of 
			the particular streams of work. For small projects, you will not need the sub projects as this adds unnecessary overhead. 
			In this case we will push forward just to see the functionality of Openproject.</p>
		</p>
		<hr />
		<hr />
		<hr />
		<hr />
		<hr />
		<hr />
		<hr />
		<hr />
		<hr />
		<p>Select Projects at the top of the menu and add a new project called <strong>IT MGT</strong></p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/createproj1.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
		<p>Add the name <strong>"IT Mgt"</strong>, add a summary, "Check all" the modules to add them all and save </p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/createproj2.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
		<p>You will be taken to the settings page. We will configure just the major items
			<ul>We will 
			<li>Add the team to the project</li>
			<li>A simple set of versions</li>
			<li>Change a backlog setting</li>
			</ul> </p>
			
					<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/creatproj3.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
			<p>Click the <strong>Members</strong> tab and use the search function to add your whole team. Each team member must be given a role as well. You
				can give team members multiple roles, but this should not be necessary for a small project. 
				If you are using the "admin" login, do not forget to add yourself to the project  
			</p>

			<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/creatproj4.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
					<p>Click the <strong>Versions</strong> tab and add two new versions "Backlog" and "Wishlist"  </p>
								
					<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/createproj5.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
					<p>Add the name, a description, a start date, change sharing to "With subprojects" and change Column in backlog to "right"</p>
					<p>You now have a location to keep department ideas/issues/plans and you can move them to your projects as you decide
						to progress them</p>
					<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/createproj6.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>					
					<p>Click the <strong>Backlog Settings</strong> tab and select "close" as the definition of done  </p>
					<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/createproj7.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>	

		<p>Return to the Administration module (Modules -> Administration on the top menu bar) and
			add second project with the name <strong>"Project X"</strong>, and make it a sub project of <strong>IT Mgt</strong>, 
			 add a summary, "Check all" the modules to add them all and save </p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/createproj8.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
		<p>When you save, you will be taken to the settings page. </p> <p>Add you team to the project as before.</p> <p> In the versions tab you will see 
			that you have inherited the wishlist and backlog of the IT department. </p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/createproj9.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>	
		<p>We will add project specific versions here called "Project X", our project and "Issues and risks" to hold the issues and risks. 
			We will also give these versions a due date based on the current best assessment and we will keep the "Column in backlog" as "left" so we 
			get all the functionality of the backlog plugin  </p>	
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/createproj10.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>	
		<p>In this project, you can also create a forum called "Change Control" and use the forum to notify the teams of pending changes. You can also add other forums 
			if you see s need such as "Planning"  </p>		
			<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/projforum1.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>	
					<p>Update the backlog settings as before  </p>
		<p>You can use the wiki to build some of your project documentation. For example, you could put the project scope in a wiki or the high level requirements.
			You also have the option of completing these documents in a word processor and saving them to the "Documents" section of the project. You 
			may decide to keep the project library outside OpenProject. The wiki allows collabortion between team members and is secure. The other options allow more
			flexibility with document creation as the wiki is in one spot only and you need access to OpenProject to use it.</p>
		<p>If you wanted use the wiki, below is a suggested approach</p>
		<p>Create your title page with general information about the project, then add the other documents as child pages to the title page</p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/wiki1.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/wiki2.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
		<p>Use the "more Functions" on the right to create further tiers of wiki pages. You can then have the team members start creating the project documents</p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/wiki3.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
		<hr />
		<p>We will now add the 3 sub-projects. This should be quicker as we will use the copy function to create the second and third projects.</p>
		<p>Return to the Administration module (Modules -> Administration on the top menu bar) and
			add a project with the name <strong>"Project X Infrastructure"</strong>, and make it a sub project of <strong>Project X</strong>, 
			 add a summary, "Check all" the modules to add them all and save </p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/createproj11.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
		<p>Add the team members and update the backlog setting for the "close" option. We do not have to add any versions, or forums or wiki's as we will
			use the Project X framework for project management and monitoring</p>
		<p>Once you have save the settings you can add the project and project type</p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/createproj13.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
		<p>Next we will copy this project for the other 2 sub projects</p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/createproj12.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
		<p>click <kbd>Copy</kbd> and fill in the project name "Project x Applications", update the description and click <kbd>Copy</kbd>. 
			Repeat this for the "Project X Desktop" sub project. The copy is a batch process, so you will need to wait to complete the final steps below</p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/createproj14.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>		
		<hr />
		<p>More information on  
		<%= link_to 'copying and templates', 'https://www.openproject.org/projects/openproject/wiki/Release_Notes_-_Copy_projects_based_on_Templates' %>
		can be found on the OpenProject site</p>
		<hr />
		<p>We are almost finished building the program framework. We need to add the project task lists for each project</p>
		<p>Select each sub-project, going into the project settings and add another "Version" called "Project X Infrastructure"
			for the infrastructure sub-project or "Project X Applications" for the application sub-project or 
			"Project X Desktop" for the desktop sub project. Make these versions "With Project Hierarchy".</p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/createproj15.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>		
	
		<hr />	
		<h3>Adding the High Level Plan</h3>
		<p>The framework is complete and we are going to build the project using the backlog plugin. It is based on an agile methodology call scrum, but the simple "sticker board"
			approach has broad appeal and can be used in many story building exercises. It is based on the 
			<%= link_to ' Kanban Board', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board' %> tool.
			<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/Simple-kanban-board-.jpg",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>	
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>There are many different ways for you to gather the information to build your skeleton project for example from templates, kick off a workshop, build it 
			from experience. I will use the following as a guide for this demonstration. It is not meant to be complete or ordered.
			<ul> Skeleton Project
				<li>Complete Requirements</li>
				<li>Complete Scope</li>
				<li>Complete Team Structure</li>
				<li>Confirm Initial Funding</li>
				<li>Book first Exec presentation</li>
				<li>Create Communication Plan</li>
				<li>Create Change Control Plan</li>
				<li>Design System and app changes</li>
				<li>Build Infrastructure</li>
				<li>Test Infrastructure</li>
				<li>Build Desktop</li>
				<li>Test Desktop</li>
				<li>Configuration Application</li>
				<li>Test New configuration</li>
				<li>User Acceptance Testing</li>
				<li>Integration Testing</li>
				<li>Commission New Product</li>
				<li>Close down</li>
			</ul>
			</p>	
		<p> These items will be entered into the backlog process and be used to build out the detailed plan</p>
			
			<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog2.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>				
			
		<hr />
		<p>Select "backlogs" under the main project - Project X, click on the dropdown arrow nex to the "backlog" version and select "New Story"</p>
		<p>Enter all your high level project tasks as a "New Story"</p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog3.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>	
		<p>Keep the phase "new" and enter a priority in the last input, press enter to save the item. These options where configured when the backlog plugin was configured. You can change them 
			in the administration module under the plugins option.</p>
			<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog4.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>				
		<hr />
		<p>You are now ready to build your project using the kanban approach or the traditional approaches</p>
		<p>Drag the items you need to work on from the backlog to the project and use either the "task board"
			or the traditional workpackages to build the next level</p> 
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog5.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>	
		<hr />
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog6.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>	
		<hr />
		<p>In the task board, click the "+" beside the Story and start adding tasks and assigning them to the team. Also estimate the hours if possible</p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog7.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>	
		<hr />
		<p>You will generate a list of colour coded tasks tha tyou can now move (drag) to in progress and the team can start working on them.
			You may want to further define each task. To do that open it up in the "Work Packages" menu option</p>

		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog8.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>	
		<hr />
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog9.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>	
		<hr />
		<p>In the Work Packages menu, you now see the task as child task of the main story. The backlog process produces only 1 level of task nesting. 
			You will need to use the Work Packages screen to produce a more complex task list.</p>	
			<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog10.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
		<hr />	
		<p>The stories now have to changed to in progress and updated with owners. The tasks have to be updated as well as the stories get their dates from the tasks. 
			Click on each story in
			the backlog screen and select update. Add an Assignee, Owner, change the status to in progress. You also have the option to start recording effort against the 
			task. Select the ctivity in the drop down and add the effor in the time spent. and add a comment on what was completed.
			Update all the tasks with their start and end dates, this will complete the first draft plan. All the tasks, by default, are coded as features. You can update
			 this to other types such as "milestone" or "support" or "bug" by clicking the "Change Properties" down arrow just above the "Status" line</p>	
		
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog11.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>	
					<p>  </p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog12.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>			
					<p>  </p>
					<p> You will see the timeline take shape. The first time you select "Timeline", you will have to create a report.You may even
						edit the tasks from the timeline reports.</p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog13.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>					
		<p>This report is a simple almost default report. It has zoom factor set to "days" and shows all the tasks. You can add columns and apply
			various filters. We will use the "projects" filter, once we move our tasks to their correct sub projects. There are various filters provided so you can fine tune the reports
			you need. </p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog14.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
		<p>  </p>
		<h4>Sub-Project Management</h4>
		<p>While this set of project tasks are too small to justify using sub-projects, it is worth seeing how this functionality works. 
			A sub-project provides additional abilities of segementation and security, workflow and reporting. </p>
		<p>You can have teams and even third parties provide updates into the system with out compromising security which is a great time saver. 
			The more independant the teams are, the more efficient the project becomes.</p>
		<p>We are going to use the backlog function to move the work to the sub-projects. We will update the project relationships and see how the 
			reporting changes</p>
		<p>Drag the stories to the sub projects. We will then update the project relationships so the timeline report shows all the projects sorted correctly</p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog15.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
		<p>You now need to update the tasks to have the same target version as the stories. Go into the workpackages screen and select the tasks that 
			still require a target version and update it to the parent target version. Note, you can pin your view to the left side menu by using the "More Functions" opion.
			This will speed up your review.</p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog16.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
		<p>Update dependancies</p>
		<%= link_to image_tag("openproject/backlog17.png",:size => '450x500', alt: "Project Mgt"  ), '#', class: 'centre' %>
