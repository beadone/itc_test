			This page will provide a simple framework for running projects and programs in small to medium business using a tailored
			<%= link_to "PMI", 'http://pmi.org' %>
			process that can be used in an opensource application called <%= link_to "OpenProject", 'http://openproject.org' %>. It will introduce a common vernacular
			to integrate project management into the daily operation cycles that run in a small to medium sized IT shop.
		</p>

		<hr />
		<p>
			IT Project management is a well documented process. It is so well documented, the major challenge is to
			decide what you will use from the available information and what you will not. There a 4 phases in the
			PMI process with a 5th process to control the project. Within each of these process groups there are many processes.
